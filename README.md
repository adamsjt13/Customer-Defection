# Customer-Defection
This repo houses the code for the final deployable modeling and predicting functions for BZAN 554 Customer Analytics Customer Defection project. The data files have not been included. The purpose of this repo is to provide coding examples of my work. Also included are the diagnostic plots used to determine the choice of final model.
